# Cousera-Meta-CSS-HTML-FP

This is a responsive web page built using semantic HTML tags and CSS.

The page includes Open Graph Protocol for better social media sharing. The `<head>` section has a `<title>` tag, a `<meta>` tag to set the charset, and the <meta> viewport tag to ensure proper scaling on mobile devices.

The `<header>` includes a `<nav>` tag with an unordered list of `<li>` tags to create a navigation bar.

The main content is enclosed in a `<main>` tag with two `<section>` tags.

The first section uses a background image and includes an `<article>` tag with a heading and a paragraph.

The second section includes three `<article>` tags, each with an image, a heading and a paragraph.

The `<footer>` includes two `<div>` tags, one with an image and the other with a paragraph that includes a link to the designer's website.

The CSS file has selectors for resetting browser defaults, setting the <body> and text defaults, and styling the elements on the page. The CSS file also imports two Google Fonts: Lora and Poppins.

The layout is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes using media queries in the CSS file.
